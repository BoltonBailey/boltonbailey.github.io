<p>I read Revelation Space in July 2020</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>This book was a great hard sci-fi with elements of horror. The plot was full of twists and it had an epic conclusion. The worldbuilding was especially good. Also refreshing to see a novel that doesn’t ignore special relativity through the use of “hyperspace” like most sci-fi does, but instead uses it as a plot device (it incites the chase that the Nostalgia for Infinity takes across multiple systems looking for Sylveste, and lets Dan have many years of experiences since his last interaction with the crew, while the crew have comparatively few).</p>
<h2 id="favorite-moments">Favorite Moments</h2>
<p>There were a <em>ton</em> of twists in this book, it basically reads like a mystery novel. Let me list all the good gotcha moments I remember (spoilers)</p>
<ul>
<li>Pascale is Sylveste’s political opponent’s daughter</li>
<li>The Sun Stealer that infected Nagorny is related to the Amarantin.</li>
<li>It was Sylveste’s shrouder pattern that collapsed, not Carine Lefevre’s.</li>
<li>Sylveste’s old excavation partner is still alive.</li>
<li>Sylveste fed his father’s alpha-level simulation to the Pattern Jugglers.</li>
<li>The Mademoiselle is Carine Lefevre.</li>
<li>The Shrouders are actually Amarantin.</li>
<li>Sylveste actually has the antimatter tooth weapon in the end (great because even we forget that it’s there)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gripes">Gripes</h2>
<p>There were a few issues. Some twists that didn’t play for me were</p>
<ul>
<li>Sajaki is really the captain, using a Pattern Juggler overlay (we don’t have enough of the Captain as a character to really figure this one out, and it doesn’t give us a revelation about Sajaki’s character for the same reason).</li>
<li>The ultra crew doesn’t really destroy a town (this felt sort of obvious, but Volyova’s emotional reaction doesn’t make sense after this comes out).</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, I felt like the Sylveste-Pascale romance plot was a bit shoehorned</p>
