<p>Those of us who cook will know the frustration of having to scroll to the end of a long food-blog post to get to the recipe. Additionally frustrating is the lack of a good way to save these recipes, forcing us to bookmark these pages and go through the scrolling process again and again. Promoting a standardized file format for these recipes would alleviate this problem, and make it easier to maintain a digital personal recipe book.</p>
<p>I have no idea if such a file format exists. Regardless, Iâ€™m going to spitball a description of one now for the hell of it, based on toml.</p>
<pre class="toml"><code>&lt;!-- Ingredients section always comes first, since shopping is the logical first step in preparing a recipe --&gt;
[Ingredients]
- [2](cups) Flour  &lt;!-- Ingredients are listed in [quantity](unit) format, to allow easier conversion between unit systems&gt;
- [1-2](tsp) sugar &lt;!-- for optional amounts, indicate with a range&gt;
- [0-1](tsp) cinnamon &lt;!-- for optional ingredients, indicate with a range going to 0&gt;
- [2](tsp) cardamom &lt;!-- If a recipe calls for the same ingredient twice in the instructions (for example, a spice if put in a marinade and then later used again for finishing) then the total quantity needed should be summed up and included in a single line int eh recipe section&gt;
- [0.5](lb) apple or pear &lt;!-- for an option between two ingredients use the form &quot;ingredient a or ingredient b&quot;&gt;
- [1](lb) chicken thighs or Diced Chicken thighs 
&lt;!-- For ingredients which can be bought in multiple ways, use &quot;or&quot; --&gt;

[Timeline]
&lt;!-- A basic timeline of the recipe including attended and unattended time --&gt;
- 5 min prepare marinade
- 30 min Marinate unattended
- 30 min bake unattended

[Instructions]
- Preaheat oven to [300](F)
- Dice Chicken Thighs
- Dice fruit 
- Add [2](cups) Flour, [1-2](tsp), [0-1](tsp), [1](tsp) cardamom, [0.5](lb) apple or pear, [1](lb) diced chicken to plastic bag
&lt;!-- Repeat the amount, the user may not remember --&gt;
&lt;!-- In particular, always be explicit about partial use of ingredient never &quot;half the cardamom&quot; always &quot;1tsp cardamom&quot;--&gt;
- Marinate for 30 min
- Bake for 30 min
