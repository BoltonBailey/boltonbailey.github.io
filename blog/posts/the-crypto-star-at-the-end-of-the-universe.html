<p><em>I’ve written before about how I think burnt or lost tokens are important to consider because they affect the price of things long term. Here, I take this idea to the extreme. Partially inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD4izuDMUQA">this</a>.</em></p>
<p>A civilization orbits a red dwarf in the far future. The system was colonized by a moonshot mission from the nearby local cluster, just before cosmological expansion made the star impossible to access. Now the colonists will be left to their own devices, counting down the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_an_expanding_universe#Star_formation_ceases">~10 trillion years</a> for the red dwarf to burn through its fuel and extinguish.</p>
<p>In the mean time, the economy of the system bustles with activity. The isolation of the system has led to extremely stable political structures which keep the human population alive and blockchains running over billions of years. The main blockchain is a smart-contract enabled chain which provides much the same functionality that Ethereum does today. Development on the chain has stopped - since other blockchains have embedded light clients for the main chain and vice versa, any update to any of them would be a technical nightmare. And there is really no reason to update anyway, since the chain uses STARK technology and is essentially maximally efficient. Smart contracts that are useful or interesting enough never leave the chainstate, so they externally exist, in competition with one another for human use and attention.</p>
<p>The stability of the blockchain system has entrenched TRU and FIL as the system-wide, default way of handling verified computation and file storage, so that both TRU and FIL have relatively stable value. In fact, their price ratio never strays more than a few orders of magnitude from a fixed constant over the millennia - fundamental tradeoffs between storing data and recomputing it in commonly-used algorithms provide a stabilizing effect. When the TRU/FIL price ratio changes, people, companies, and more complex smart contracts like the one that manages the government simply switch their algorithms to rely less on the more expensive asset, bringing the price back to normal.</p>
<p>In the beginning various AMMs exist, offering a variety of governance mechanisms and fee schemes. In the first few centuries though, users and programmers integrating AMMs into their software gravitate away from AMMs with human-controlled governance mechanisms due to the inability to formally prove guarantees about their future behavior. Network effects lead the solar system economy to converge on very simple low-gas AMMs, similar to Uniswap v1 or Uniswap v3, some without any governance at all, some with governance that allows for predefined or programmatic changes to parameters.</p>
<p>While millennium-scale stability keeps the ratio constant, decade-scale fluctuations in the economy causes the TRU/FIL pair contracts to accumulate fees. A few users make mistakes and inadvertently burn their liquidity tokens. Meanwhile, fees are distributed to burned and unburned liquidity tokens alike. This causes “burnt liquidity” to take up a larger and larger share of the total liquidity provision, since the supply of liquidity from entities that can remove liquidity at will is unchanged, while the burned supply keeps growing through fees. Eventually, it becomes unprofitable for unburnt providers to supply liquidity at all, and we are left with AMMs solely supported through the existing burnt liquidity.</p>
<p>The decade-scale price variance grows initially as this increased liquidity changes the economic climate. New business models that rely on this stability burst onto the landscape from time to time, but they are eventually integrated into the system and become well-understood by investors with centuries of data. As time goes on, the burnt liquidity grows, and the price curve becomes flatter and flatter, causing the variance to decrease to nothing. We enter an era where the TRU/FIL market slowly flattens around the “true price”, determined by the macroeconomic features of the storage and computation markets and issuance schemes of the tokens.</p>
<p>As centuries turn into millennia and millennia turn into myriadennia, the governance contracts for the AMMs jockey for position. They analyze market trends, sometimes spending years in hibernation trying to statistically understand what makes users choose one AMM over another. The smart ones set their fees to undercut others. The smarter ones make deals with each other, committing themselves not encroach on each others territory. Some governance mechanisms retire themselves, hoping to capture the market of applications that require predictable behavior.</p>
<p>After billions of years of price curve flattening, we reach a point where there is so much liquidity in AMMs that the smallest quantum of gas costs more than the slippage of even the largest volume trades. Users gravitate towards AMMs with the most extremely simple swap functions. Even constant-product AMMs are slightly disadvantaged - the optimal AMMs are now those that buy and sell at fixed prices extremely close together. Instead of the price of a token steadily increasing by default as the AMMs runs low on it, the governance mechanism changes the hard-coded price itself.</p>
<p>Civilization around the star ticks on this way, with the few AMMs left providing their liquidity to all who find a use for it. To the users of the software, it is now essentially taken for granted that these two commodities are perfectly fungible with each other. The economy persists in peace as the universe recedes to redshift in the black night sky.</p>
