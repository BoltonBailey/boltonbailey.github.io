<h1 class="title">Is Authoritarianism Good for Space Colonization</h1>
<p class="date">2021-06-01T21:22:00-04:00</p>

<p>This post is predicated on a dualistic view of interstellar civilization: One “liberal” morally good mode which is full of happy, free people who experience good things who can basically control their lives and what goes on around them, and another “authoritarian” morally bad mode, where people are either slaves or don’t exist at all, and power is controlled by a uncaring evil overlord entity. We imagine that all cultures exist on a scale between these two extremes.</p>
<p>Here is an argument for you to think about.</p>
<p>Despite the liberal government being morally better than authoritarian government, <strong>it would still be good to create a highly authoritarian and hawkish governmental structure for Von Neumann probe colonies</strong>, given the following assumptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The authoritarian/liberal and hawkish/peaceful qualities are culturally stable enough that they are the same for all entities originating from a single system and impossible to change once expansion begins.</li>
<li>Authoritarian politics confers an advantage in interstellar conflict, to the point that a civ which is much more liberal than a bordering one will consistently lose ground in a territorial war.</li>
<li>At some point in the evolution of the universe, there will be a time when there is a non-negligible chance of appearance of alien civilizations that are very authoritarian and hawkish.</li>
<li>An isotropic universe where the probability of an expansion beginning at a particular time with particular qualities is the same over equal volumes of space.</li>
</ol>
<p>Point 1 allows us to model the universe as a collection of civilizations with a <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> parameter representing liberty and a binary variable representing hawkishness. Point 2 tells us the territorial dynamics of such a universe - the hawkish overtake those sufficiently less authoritarian than them. Using the isotropy assumption, we can say that authoritarian hawkish civilizations appear by time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in a Poisson process with volume frequency <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and interpreting “hawkish” to mean that such civilizations expand outward at minimum speed <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> we can assume that after time <span class="math inline">\(T \approx \sqrt[3]{f}/v\)</span> all of space, including Earth’s light cone, is within the range of such civilizations after time <span class="math inline">\(t + T\)</span>. Thus, the only way humans will survive is to be authoritarian enough to defend against attacks from maximally authoritarian neighbors. Even if liberty is morally better, it is still better that the territory we acquire be ultimately human and <strong>just authoritarian enough to defend itself</strong>, than that it ultimately be alien and maximally authoritarian. It is even <strong>morally better to be hawkish and destroy totally peaceful and liberal civilizations</strong>, since otherwise, such civilizations will eventually be overtaken by even more authoritarian civilizations than we are.</p>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-assumptions">Analyzing the Assumptions</h2>
<p>I feel point 1 in this argument is the weakest, since you could imagine a liberal government willingly becoming authoritarian once it realized that it was the only way to beat the Klingons, replicators, and peacekeepers of the universe, or having border territories be controlled by liberal superintelligences that generally respect the wishes of the humans on the interior, but will take whatever resources they need to perfectly defend the border. The argument in favor of point 1 is that existing power structures try to perpetuate themselves. It may be that the most common stellar governments are based on very fit memes which effectively replicate themselves to neighboring star systems.</p>
<p>The intuition behind point 2 is that if there is democratic control of power, they may make bad security decisions based on their personal wants. For example, if it takes 1000 years of preparation in terms of moving resources to the border to defend civilization, and the removal of these resources hurts the quality of life of those living on the border, and the threat of conquest is 1000 years away, people may choose to ignore the threat.</p>
<p>There is a self-reinforcing argument involved in step 3. If all aliens make simulations of the technological adolescence of other aliens, and they find a base rate of authoritarian outcomes, they may discover this very argument and conclude it is best to become more authoritarian themselves. If aliens prefer, authoritarianism paribus, that their own descendants should have more power, then we reach a prisoners dilemma in which aliens choose to be more authoritarian because they believe others will.</p>
<h3 id="insulation">Insulation</h3>
<p>A hole in my argument comes from the fact that slightly authoritarian civilizations can insulate other civilizations from more authoritarian ones. Fix a numerical scale on liberty so that it’s possible to conquer someone if they have 1 more liberty than you. If maximally authoritarian (liberty=0) civilizations are rare, and liberty=1 civilizations arrive earlier or are much more common, then if we choose to expand with liberty=2 we would likely be surrounded by liberty=1 civilizations and could survive, since the liberty=0 civilizations would not be able to expand to border us.</p>
<p>Examining this further, assuming that civilizations all arise around the same time and spread at the same speed, then a civilization can expect to encounter <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> others, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the expected number of adjacencies of 3D Voronoi cells for a Poisson process of points. I would expect this to be higher in three dimensions than two, so <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is probably <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/19694/what-is-the-most-frequent-number-of-edges-of-voronoi-cells-of-a-large-set-of-ran">at least 6</a>. I would therefore conjecture that for most distributions on liberty, the effect of this insulation argument is small.</p>
