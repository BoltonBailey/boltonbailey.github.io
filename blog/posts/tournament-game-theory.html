<p>This has no value I am aware of, but I think it could be a fun exercise to develop a mathematical theory around games like rock-paper-scissors and rock-paper-scissors lizard spock, and other generalizations of that idea.</p>
<h2 id="background-and-problem-statement">Background and Problem Statement</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_(graph_theory)">tournament</a> is a directed graph where any two distinct vertices have exactly one directed edge joining them. Given a tournament, consider the symmetric, two-player, zero-sum, normal form game where the action sets are the sets of vertices of the tournament, and where, if the players moves are distinct, then a player receives +1 payoff iff the edge joining the moves originates on their chosen vertex. Call such a game a <em>tournament game</em>. We will refer to such a game and its related tournament interchangeably.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture</strong> A tournament game has a unique mixed strategy nash equilibrium.</p>
<p><strong>Conjecture</strong> If a tournament game has a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium with each action receiving nonzero probability, that MSNE is unique.</p>
<p><em>Proof attempts</em> <!-- Let $M$ be the payoff matrix of a tournament game having minimum actions among those with multiple MSNEa.  --> The set of MSNE is a convex polytope in the probability simplex, the intersection of <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in \Delta : x M_i \ge 0 \}\)</span> for each action <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Suppose this polytope is nontrivial.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a game of the aforementioned form has a unique MSNE, this MSNE may have the property that all actions have nonzero probability of being played. This property is desirable since if there is a strategy with 0 probability, there is no reason to have a hand symbol for it in a format like rock-paper-scissors. Call such games non-simplifiable tournament games, or NSTG.</li>
<li>If no strategy dominates another, does this imply non-simplifiability? Prove that no strategy dominating another implies a cycle.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="classifying-nstgs">Classifying NSTGs</h2>
<p>Let us enumerate a few NSTGs:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is the trivial NSTG of order 1.</li>
<li>Rock-Paper-Scissors is the smallest nontrivial NSTG, with size 3.</li>
<li>There are no NSTGs of size 4.</li>
<li>but there are two of size 5 up to isomorphism.
<ul>
<li>Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock</li>
<li>Another game which can be thought of as a game of RPS where an additional RPS is played to decide a tie where both players threw rock.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The above points suggest two ways of constructing NSTGs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>For any odd n, we may construct an NSTG where the action space is <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_n\)</span> and the winner is determined by <span class="math inline">\((a-b) \mod n\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\((n-1)/2\)</span>. It can be seen that the unique MSNE assigns equal probability to all actions.</li>
<li>Given an “index” NSTG <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span>, the action space of which indexes into a set of additional NSTGs <span class="math inline">\(\{X_i\}_{i \in I}\)</span>, we define a new <em>coproduct NSTG</em> on the action space <span class="math inline">\(\coprod_I X_i\)</span>, that is, the disjoint union of the action spaces of the <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>. Let the winner between <span class="math inline">\((i_1, x_1)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((i_2, x_2)\)</span> be the winner of <span class="math inline">\(i_1, i_2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> if they are different, otherwise the winner between <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span>. The MSNE probability of <span class="math inline">\(i, x\)</span> is the product of the MSNE probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>An interesting question is whether induction on the above two constructions yield all NSTGs up to isomorphism. It turns out to be false: Note that the above only gives us odd order NSTGs, but inspection shows that there is an NSTG of order 6.</p>
<p>This leads us to some more high-level questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we classify the simple NSTGs? (that is, the NSTGs that cannot be made from smaller NSTGs by the second construction above)</li>
<li>What is (a good way of computing) the number of isomorphism classes of NSTGs of a given order?</li>
<li>Can we use the fact that there must be a hamiltonian directed cycle?</li>
<li>Can we specify a normal form on the payoff matrix, then construct all valid matrices in linear time?</li>
</ul>
