<h1 class="title">Ion Thruster Orbital Dynamics</h1>

<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster">Ion thruster</a> is a form of propulsion used for spacecraft, known for having a very long lifetime, but producing relatively little thrust. After seeing all the Mars-bound rockets in the news recently, I wondered if it would in theory be possible for an Ion thruster propelled spacecraft in Low Earth Orbit to escape the Earth-Moon system and execute an interplanetary mission.</p>
<p>Let me formalize some assumptions: Our setting is an idealized two-body system, consisting of a perfectly spherical planet with a single perfectly spherical moon in a circular orbit. Our spacecraft can produce a fixed acceleration in any direction, and it will function until the end of time, or until it crashes into the surface of either the planet or its moon.</p>
<p>Given these parameters, and a starting position and velocity for the spacecraft, there are three possibilities as to the astronaut’s fate.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>She is doomed: The craft is on a collision course and there is simply not enough thrust to pilot the craft to avoid destruction.</li>
<li>She can escape: Taking advantage of the maneuverability of her craft and the gravitational dynamics of her environment, the pilot can adroitly avoid the massive spheres and accelerate up and away, eventually reaching escape velocity and leaving to explore the vastness of space.</li>
<li>She can survive but is trapped: While she can avoid a fiery death, there is no way for the pilot to achieve more than some maximum distance from the planet-moon system.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-be-trapped">Is it Possible to be Trapped?</h2>
<p>It’s hard to see that (3) is possible without some imagination. Suppose that one body is much more massive and a very small radius, while the other body has a much larger radius, but negligible mass (to be more precise, the thrust of the craft is low with respect to the surface gravity of the high mass body, and the properties of the other body are extreme even with respect to these forces and this ratio).</p>
<p>Maybe the best visualization is to think of this system as a gas giant orbiting a neutron star. The spacecraft starts orbiting the neutron star at an altitude of one meter. Stretching the bounds of our imagination further, let’s say that the gas giant has such a large radius that the surface of the gas giant and the neutron star are only 2 meters apart. While this is totally unrealistic in terms of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit">Roche limit</a> of the neutron star, it works in our ideal system.</p>
<p>The spacecraft is safe as long as it doesn’t venture outside of its 1 meter altitude orbit, and the negligibility of the gravity of the gas giant means the spacecraft will never be forced to do so. Thus, we are not in condition 1.</p>
<p>But what about escape? The pilot can apply thrust perpendicular to the surface of the star to change into any 1-meter altitude orbit. On the time scale of the orbit of the spacecraft, the gas giant is essentially stationary. Thus, before increasing her altitude, the pilot will need to enter an orbital plane around the star that is nearly parallel to the nearby surface of the gas giant. TODO not rigorous. But as the pilot slowly increases the altitude of the craft, the ratio of the timescales of the orbit of the spacecraft and the orbit of the gas giant falls. The thrust of the craft is so low that even at full power she can’t change the angle of the orbital plane by more than a fraction of a degree every orbit. Eventually the gas giant moves into the orbital plane of the spacecraft and crushes it.</p>
<p>This extreme example is a bit hand-wavy, but it tells us that situation 3 is possible. But it leads to other questions, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping the surface-to-surface distance of the planets small with respect to the other parameters, what relations, if any, between the masses of the planets and the radii of the planets lead to scenario 3 when the ratio of the radii is large?</li>
<li>Given a system in which situation 3 arises for some thrusts, how can we calculate the critical thrust-to-mass above which the craft escapes?</li>
<li>I chose the mass of the gas giant in the above to be negligible so I didn’t have to worry about it. In the limit as the thrust of the spacecraft goes to 0, do resonance effects of the moon on the spacecraft make it impossible to rise above a certain orbital frequency? In other words, is escape still sometimes impossible as the radius of one or both of the bodies goes to 0?</li>
<li>Where does the Earth-Moon system fall on this spectrum?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some failed attempts at constructing systems I could prove were type 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two equal-mass, equal-radius bodies, almost kissing, with the craft directly between them. In this case the craft can escape by oscillating north and south, staying on the axis of rotation of the orbits, applying thrust to increase the oscillation, until it can escape.</li>
<li>Two nonequal-mass bodies, almost kissing, with the craft at the L1 Lagrangian point and the radii of the bodies extending almost to this point. This might work, but I couldn’t quickly prove to myself that an oscillation strategy doesn’t work here as well.</li>
<li>A large radius, high mass planet which the craft orbits, with a low-mass, low-radius moon in a higher orbit. At first it seems like this can be situation 3: we think of the orbit of the craft as a continuously varying closed path, and the orbit of the moon as a thickened closed path. Any intersection of these paths leads to a crash, if we let the change in the spacecraft path be slow with respect to the difference in orbital period between the center of the moon and the surface of the near side of the moon. But unfortunately, if we let the craft enter an orbit stationary in the rotating reference frame, the gravitational influence of the moon can’t be negligible.</li>
</ul>
