<h1 class="title">Interstellar Warfare Questions</h1>

<p>Robin Hanson’s recent <a href="https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/12/how-far-aggressive-aliens.html">blog posts</a> talk a lot about the potential future of space colonization, but don’t cover the potential for territorial wars between neighboring civilizations. It seems interesting to examine the possible social and military dynamics of these wars, as they could have <a href="./is-authoritarianism-good-for-space-colonization.html">implications for our colonization strategy</a>.</p>
<h2 id="quantitative-questions">Quantitative Questions</h2>
<p>These are specific questions about the geometry of territorial dynamics. We assume some initial configuration of stars under the control of particular civilizations with certain goals, then ask whose goals can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="defending-a-border">Defending a Border</h3>
<p><em>What is the smallest distance such that an optimal defender can consistently defend the space between two half-planes at that distance from an optimal attacker controlling all other space?</em></p>
<p>A strategy for the defender near a border might be to just use whatever strategy the attacker is using, and hope that this strategy doesn’t require too many resources from far away. Thus, this question gets at the value of controlling distant resources.</p>
<h3 id="defending-an-enclave">Defending an Enclave</h3>
<p><em>Given a particular uniform stellar density, what is the smallest radius of a spherical volume which an optimal defender could consistently defend from an optimal attacker controlling all other space?</em></p>
<p>One strategy involves the attacker just sending spaceships at the defender - eventually so much matter inflows into the defender’s region that the defender is overwhelmed. Thus, the hubble constant may be a relevant parameter in answering this question.</p>
<p>For a large enough radius, a strategy for the defender near a border might be to copy the half-space strategy.</p>
<p><em>For smaller radii/tighter border curvatures, how quickly can an attacker gain ground?</em></p>
<p>A helpful tactic is to use the speed of light as a barrier. For example, if the defender’s sole goal is to defend a single point, and they can form a sphere around the point of radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> where the enemy’s controlled territory in that sphere is a subset of a rotation of the defender’s controlled territory in the sphere, then the defender can adopt a strategy stealing argument to control the center of the sphere for time at least <span class="math inline">\(r/c\)</span> (though they might not be able to defend any other point in the sphere with this strategy).</p>
<h2 id="qualitative-questions">Qualitative questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Suppose two competing civilizations each start controlling one half of space. After a fixed time: Does the border remain flat, or does it have a chance of curving or forming exclaves? How does the topology of stars affect probability of control? (E.g. is a star with several nearby enemy stars likely to be overwhelmed?)</li>
<li>Is interstellar warfare like island hopping, where you choose a random star near the border controlled by an enemy and send the resources of a bunch of stars after it to capture it?</li>
<li>What is the politics like at triple points or quadruple points?
<ul>
<li>Is a soap-bubble like configuration the most stable?</li>
<li>Do civilizations seamlessly blend into one another culturally?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Is dispersing the resources of a system that is about to be attacked, as Anders Sandberg <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/space-races-settling.pdf">has suggested</a>, a feasible scorched earth strategy? *If so, how quickly could a superintelligent seed probe of moderate mass disperse a sun-sized star?</li>
</ul>
