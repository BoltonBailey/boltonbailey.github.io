# Bolton's Blog

In my late college years, I made a markdown file on my computer where I would write down ideas I had. Over the years, ideas accreted in that file, until I eventually split it in to two files, then five. I would go back and elaborate on those ideas, and it got to the point where a lot of the subsections in these files were essentially mini-essays on various topics I was interested in. I've been able to turn one or two of these ideas into actionable research, but most of them sit at the level of interesting, but not quite novel or evidence-based enough to publish academically. So instead, I try to convert them into blog posts, and I put them here.

I still have a pretty big backlog of thoughts that haven't been moved here yet, so consider this blog a work-in-progress. It's relaxing not to have to worry about originality here, so in many cases, the things I post may be things that others have realized, and which I am just cryptomnesiacally regurgitating. I'll try to give credit where I can, though.

I also don't always remember when I first started writing something, so some dates might be inaccurate.

Also, some of my ideas are just bad. Don't intentionally crash satellites into each other because I told you to.
