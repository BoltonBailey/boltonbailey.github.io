<p>I made a little AI (<a href="freecell.py">code here</a>) to solve FreeCell solitaire deals. I did this by taking advantage of the python graph manipulation library <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">networkx</a> as well as a bit of python duck typing I’m quite proud of.</p>
<p>In FreeCell, there are certain rules for how you are allowed to move cards around based on their suit and rank. Since there aren’t any hidden cards like in some other solitaires, you can think of a directed graph with all valid FreeCell positions as vertices, with edges corresponding to legal card movements. Since a networkx graph is represented as a dict of dicts, all I had to do was implement a hashable FreeCell <code>Position</code> class and then create a subclass of <code>nx.DiGraph</code> that implemented <code>__getitem__()</code> to lazily compute the neighbors of any given node in the graph. I then created a heuristic and used the networkx implementation of A* to start solving.</p>
<p>My solver is fast on some instances, but gets stuck on others. My heuristic is not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#Admissibility">“admissable”</a>, but I wonder if it can be improved.</p>
