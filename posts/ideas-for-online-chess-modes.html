<h1 class="title">Ideas for Online Chess Modes</h1>
<p class="date">2020-08-22T23:11:41-07:00</p>
</header>
<p>These are just a few ideas I had for modes/functionalities that could be nice to have on a site like chess.com or lichess.org.</p>
<h2 id="premoves">Premoves</h2>
<ul>
<li>If a premove (or sequence of premoves) is checkmate, it should be processed as a win immediately so you can move on.</li>
<li>There should be an option for “if my move is forced, make it automatically”.</li>
<li>Option for “if my opponents move is forced, make it appear automatically”. The opponent would not see this move until they input it themselves, but it would allow the player to easily see the board for their next move. If they made their next move before their opponent, it would appear to the opponent as if it were a premove.</li>
<li>Option to be able to input game trees to extend premove capabilities, (i.e. you go to a board editor, make a move for your opponent, and then input what your response would be). Thus, if you have a mate in 3 that can’t be pre-moved, your opponent can’t flame you by leaving.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="positional-practice-mode">Positional Practice Mode</h2>
<p>A game mode augmented by a computer that disallows any move which decreases the players eval by more than 2.0, say. Thus, your only consideration is to play positionally, and not consider tactics.</p>
<h2 id="continuation-with-tactics-puzzles">Continuation with Tactics Puzzles</h2>
<p>It is often frustrating, on lichess.org or chess.com, to get a tactic wrong and not understand what was wrong with the move you played. Therefore, when you miss a tactic, you should be able to continue the game, playing against a top-tier AI. Ideally, you should not even have to select a button to do this, just keep making moves. Taking this idea to its conclusion, if you win the game, you should be awarded points for the puzzle (although in a well-constructed puzzle this, is impossible).</p>
<h2 id="simul-tournament">Simul Tournament</h2>
<p>A tournament where every player plays every other in a simul. The next board you are shown is that of your opponent with the shortest queue. You have an hour to play the whole tournament. If a game is unfinished at the end of the time, the player who has spent more time with no games in the queue wins (allowing one up on time to strategically not play if they have finished most of their games quickly). Unfortunately, this scheme leads to stronger players having more time spent against them. You could alternatively use a fixed time per move scheme.</p>
<h2 id="hand-and-brain">Hand and Brain</h2>
<p>chess.com added (recently, I think) bughouse. It shouldn’t be too hard from here to make hand and brain a game mode.</p>
