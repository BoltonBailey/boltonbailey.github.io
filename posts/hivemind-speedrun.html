<h1 class="title">Hivemind Speedrun</h1>

<p>You have the become the first member of a hivemind. The hivemind spreads from human to human by skin-to-skin contact. Whenever a new human joins being touched by a current member, they instantly gain telepathic connection to the hive - they can communicate, share skills, and use the knowledge of all other members. There are no outward signs of being a member of the hive. If the hive deemed it prudent, a host could simply continue on with its life as normal after its assimilation. The goal of the hive is monovalent and simple: Infect all of humanity as fast as possible.</p>
<h2 id="minute-0-initial-strategy">Minute 0: Initial strategy</h2>
<p>If we live in a household with other people, it should not be too hard to get some quick infections and begin expanding. If we live alone, we have to play things a little safer. Perhaps the biggest mistake we could make would be to become aggressive too early: If we spook someone by breaking into their home and running at them and they happen to have a gun, our dream of uniting the earth under one mind might end quickly. Probably the most prudent move is to go outside and approach someone under a pretext (“have you seen my dog?”) and try to infect them subtly. If no one is in sight, knock on doors until someone opens the door and is within easy reach. Once we establish at least one infection this way, we can be much more aggressive with breaking and entering or running and tagging strangers, since we have backups to replace any member who gets hurt.</p>
<h2 id="minute-5-the-highway">Minute 5: The highway</h2>
<p>In five minutes or so, we should have enough members that we can feel confident about moving forward with rapid expansion.</p>
<p>The bottleneck on infection speed is dominated by how quickly any one member of the hive can travel. Thus, the first order of business is to reach an airport as quickly as possible. This is likely best accomplished by acquiring multiple cars and speeding towards down the highway at the maximum speed we can drive without crashing (one member can look up directions to the airport and transmit them telepathically). We can take risks running red lights, since there are enough of us to accept some loss of life to ensure maximum speed. Accidents may also help overwhelm the police, which is a bonus.</p>
<p>Probably the worst case scenario is that a cop catches one of us speeding at 120MPH on the highway and decides the best course of action is to set a patrol car barricade on the highway between you and the airport. This would slow us down, so its probably best that any of us who attract police attention slow down and pull off the main road to and try to assimilate the officer. The police can also be readily distracted by placing 911 calls alleging</p>
<h2 id="minute-30-the-airport">Minute 30: The airport</h2>
<p>Assuming we start in the US, we can expect on the median to be about <a href="https://www.mark-pearson.com/airport-distances/">17 miles</a> from the nearest airport. Conservatively, it will take us a few tens of minutes to reach it after some of us get in cars.</p>
<p>Approaching the airport, we may want to stop berserking momentarily, since TSA can be touchy, and if they see a bunch of individuals rushing the security checkpoint, they might call in a terrorist attack, leading ATC to go into shutdown mode. Ideally, a member or two who look like they might be a family cut to the front of thee line under the pretext of a family member holding a place for them (hopefully they can assimilate a likely victim before they can object that they are not your cousin). Once a single line member is infected, the whole line can quickly follow. If the TSA officer checking IDs and boarding passes is in a vestibule, it is perhaps best to ignore assimilating them entirely and just bluff past the security checkpoint. Once in the terminal we can run under the pretext of being late for a flight. We can infect a few athletic individuals and they can run to whichever gates are closing their boarding processes the soonest (by now, the zone within about a mile of our point of origin is completely under our control, we use those hosts to research which flights are leaving soonest and where to catch them).</p>
<h2 id="hour-1---hour-20-in-flight">Hour 1 - Hour 20: In flight</h2>
<p>At the very worst, the airport less than 2 miles from one point to any other. The interior of the airport should be under our control within 10 minutes or so. From this point, we should prioritize the pretense of normality so that ATC doesn’t suspect a hijacking.</p>
<p>We can spread from airport to airport in this way. We don’t even really have to alter flight plans - most airports will have flights to enough different locations that our sphere of influence will spread quickly. Going off <a href="https://travel.stackexchange.com/a/69536">this estimate</a> we should reach essentially every airport in the world after 26 hours or so. Before we discuss what to do in the last few hours as we close in on the point on earth opposite where we started</p>
<p>TODO might overrunning military bases and taking control of superfast jets be a better course of action?</p>
<h2 id="taking-cities">Taking cities</h2>
<p>Upon landing in a city, we can usually overtake it fairly quickly, and without too much risk of media attention. Some of us can drive to various suburbs, while some of us target important buildings such as police stations, public transit areas, and telecommunication hubs. We can knock on doors and touch people as they open them.</p>
<p>Despite our inevitability, it is still smart to avoid raising an alarm. If ten people try to break down a locked door to infect someone, a bad scenario can occur if video of what’s happening escapes to the internet. Of course, we will eventually resort to this anyway, but if this happens too early too often, a survivalist type in the middle of nowhere might realize the end has come and get a head start on hiding in the woods, which could add minutes to our time in the endgame. Thus, it’s probably best not to be too pushy. If a group of hosts gets a good look through a window and assesses that they can assimilate an interior before a phone can be reached, then it might be fine to take it by force. But otherwise, its better to wait until we are within sight of our goal before we begin open aggression.</p>
<h2 id="hour-20---hour-26-coming-out-in-the-open">Hour 20 - Hour 26: Coming out in the open</h2>
<p>By hour 20, we have infected 80% of most cities, excepting potentially a few on the other side of the world. At this point there is some advantage to be gained in large scale teamwork of the sort that can’t really be concealed.</p>
<p>We begin to bang down doors and jump through windows. Heavily defended government buildings like the white house can be overrun by sheer body count. Some world leaders may be successfully taken to secure bunkers. One option is to try to avoid this by infiltrating these institutions at an earlier point. Another option is just to get some explosive as close as possible to the door and keep hammering.</p>
<p>TODO research the US president’s bunker. How secure is it?</p>
<h2 id="hour-26---27-bum-rush-the-last-holdouts">Hour 26 - 27 : Bum rush the last holdouts</h2>
<p>The last holdouts will probably be people living in remote places. It might be prudent to try parachuting in some of us with satellite phones.</p>
