<p>Maybe what we need to be doing to prevent Kessler Syndrome is to have <em>more</em> debris collisions not less.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, hear me out! One of the challenges that leads to space debris accumulating is that there’s no energy-efficient way of deorbiting space debris that already exists. If we can collide space debris with other space debris in a controlled way, we can use the energy lost in the collision as a way to decrease the total energy of the debris to the point where some of it intersects the atmosphere.</p>
<p>One way of doing this could be to reach international agreement on a set of intersecting “Ley lines” - orbits designated for debris. Cleanup satellites would colocate with debris, disassemble it as much as possible, and move the parts to one of these Ley lines. The cleanup sat would then leave the Ley line orbit and wait for the debris to collide with debris from other Ley lines at the intersection point.</p>
<p>(The Ley line is named, of course, for 1960’s science writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Ley">Willy Ley</a> who was perhaps the <a href="https://archive.org/details/Galaxy_v18n06_1960-08/page/n69/mode/2up?view=theater">first to suggest</a> a spacecraft mission to deorbit defunct satellites.)</p>
<p>The collisions would generate more debris of course, but there are some advantages to the Ley line concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satellites could purposely avoid Ley lines and points, and thus inhabit space with a lesser density of debris than otherwise.</li>
<li>For any given Ley point, and any other fixed point in orbit, there is only one orbital plane that intersects both points, and only a subset of orbits in that plane intersecting both points do not intersect earth. Thus, infrastructure scanning for debris to avoid potential collisions with a specific satellite can pay special attention to these potential orbital debris paths. Additionally, satellites could be equipped with movable shields which could be repositioned based on this information to protect against the most probable trajectory of dangerous incoming debris.</li>
<li>Debris generated from collisions at Ley points would end up with an orbit intersecting that same Ley point, so if this debris does not fall into the atmosphere, it will come back to the intersection point, allowing for more collisions, and more subtraction from the total energy of space debris. If debris collided enough times, hopefully it would be pulverized to the point where it would not have a big affect on satellites.</li>
<li>With more coordination, Ley lines and points could be generated on the fly based on data about existing debris. Cleanup bots could predict collisions days in advance and move other debris to collide at the same time, potentially making a very big reduction in energy all at once.</li>
<li>Cleanup satellites could angle the debris in order to make the resulting collision debris particularly likely to intersect the atmosphere.</li>
<li>(This is more speculative), We could create some kind of big ball of matter that is “sticky” in that it doesn’t give off debris when smaller debris collides with it. Perhaps a big lump of heavy metal would do. Then these balls could be placed on the Ley lines to absorb debris.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-to-place-the-ley-lines">Where to place the Ley lines</h2>
<p>The Ley lines would want to be chosen away from useful orbits in such a way that each intersection point would have multiple Ley lines incident on it, while also making the lines a small <span class="math inline"><em>ϵ</em></span>-covering of the space of possible orbits under the delta-v metric. Here are some sketches of possible configurations for Ley lines I came up with (Earth courtesy of NASA).</p>

<h2 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h2>
<p>This scenario is the most feasible in a future where debris detection and avoidance maneuvers are highly advanced, but the cost of putting propellant in space is high. Imagine that every satellite knows the trajectory of all debris that could possibly harm it, and is even able to simulate collisions to predict new debris. Thus, the only reason to deorbit debris at all is to minimize the amount of expensive propellant satellites have to spend avoiding it. But since propellant is expensive, satellites do not want to reserve a portion of it to deorbit themselves at the end of their life, nor do they want to repeatedly move debris they find into a decaying orbit. As a compromise, laws designate that satellite companies must commit to moving mass roughly equal to the solid mass of satellites they launch into Ley line orbits.</p>
