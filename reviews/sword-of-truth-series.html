<h2 id="when-did-i-readwatch-this">When did I read/watch this</h2>
<p>I read the first book, Wizard’s First Rule, in September-August 2020. I also started watching the television adaptation around this time.</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>The reviews of this <em>Wizard’s First Rule</em> on Goodreads made this seem pretty horrible. But I was feeling the need for some guilty pleasure, and I liked the “Gar” creature from the book preview so I decided to buy it. Some of the gripes I heard are pretty fair: There are no morally grey characters - the protagonists are Mary Sues and the antagonists are essentially all rapists of some form or another. Zedd is a little bit more ambiguous, but some of the moral decision making from richard just comes out so stilted. There are a few passages, even in the first book (I’m told it gets worse), that definitely smack of Ayn Rand. A big chunk of the book is just about the protagonist being tortured.</p>
<p>Some other complaints: The Mud People section was a bit white-savior-y.</p>
<p>All that being said, I didn’t hate it. I thought the world-building was solid. The ending was definitely strong. The game theory with Darken Rahl and Richard and the boxes of Orden is rather ingenious.</p>
<p>For some reason I don’t quite understand, I like when romantic tension between the main pair arises from a practical reason rather than a social reason. It could have easily been written that the reason Kahlan and Richard couldn’t be together was because of some form of sacred vow Kahlan took as a confessor, but Goodkind comes up with the rather outrageous “I love you, but we can’t have sex because if I have an orgasm, it would literally destroy your soul”. It’s especially fun to watch network television writers try to explain this while avoiding the word “orgasm”.</p>
<h2 id="favorite-moments">Favorite Moments</h2>
<p>Rachel’s escape scene was great, because you know she’s going to have to go back for the doll.</p>
<h2 id="originality-and-premise">Originality and Premise</h2>
<p>I love the Confessor’s power premise. I think it’s super fun to game out how to take over the world with mind-control touch.</p>
<h2 id="other-problems">Other Problems</h2>
<p>Richard forgets about Rahl’s wizard’s web on him way too fast.</p>
<p>Not really a plot hole, but Richard being Darken Rahl’s son and Zedd’s Grandson is just sort of shoehorned in. I liked it better when Richard was just a normal guy “I’m just a forest guide”.</p>
<p>The evilness of Michael is a bit too thick at the beginning, so we know he’s bad. It feels a little weird how blind Richard is to Michael’s behavior. The whole “Michael betrayed you” doesn’t make sense - did Zedd and Kahlan give the box to Michael? Why would they trust him? When Zedd and Kahlan realize Rahl has the third box, they don’t make the connection to Michael, probably because it would call attention to this hole.</p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>Goodkind has little style to speak of.</p>
