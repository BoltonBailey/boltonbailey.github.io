<p>I read this in April 2022. I thought it was good. It scratched an itch which I had been feeling for some time: The desire to read a fantasy novel about an extremely simple world. There are a few elements of horror, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.</p>

<h2 id="premise-if-this-sounds-interesting-to-you-you-might-want-to-read-this">Premise (If this sounds interesting to you, you might want to read this)</h2>
<p>Piranesi lives in a World which consists of a three-story House, with Halls lined with Statues that lead to other Halls, stretching on forever. The upper floor is filled with Clouds, the lower floor is drowned in Waters, in which Piranesi fishes for food. He documents his World and relays his findings the World’s only other living inhabitant, the Other. The World is all Piranesi knows, but perhaps there is more that he does not want to remember…</p>
<h2 id="themes">Themes</h2>
<p>This is a very thematic book (there is a plot but most of it is told through flashback). Here are what I felt were the main themes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cults</li>
<li>Companionship and loneliness</li>
<li>Conceptions of the supernatural</li>
<li>Spirituality</li>
<li>Man’s connection to nature</li>
<li>Identity</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fan-theory">Fan theory?</h2>
<p>Are Sylvia D’Agostino and Sarah Raphael connected? Both are described as “androgynous” and as having dark pulled-back hair. But by the end of the novel it’s clear that they aren’t the same person. Related perhaps? What are we meant to get from this?</p>
