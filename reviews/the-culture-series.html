<h2 id="when-did-i-readwatch-this">When did I read/watch this</h2>
<p>I read <em>Consider Phlebas</em>, <em>Player of Games</em>, and <em>Use of Weapons</em> in September 2019</p>
<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>The first three books all feel totally different to me. <em>Consider Phlebas</em> is sort of a grab-bag of tropes (the band of pirates, the castaway on the island of cultists, the high-stakes poker game). Still, I liked it enough to keep reading.</p>
<p><em>Player of Games</em> was different - I thought the character of a really skilled game player was interesting, something I had never seen before, but I think Gurgeh and the plot points involving the games may only really appeal to board game nerds. The idea of a planet with a cyclical wave of fire was awesome, and made for a great climax. The ending twist with the narrator was super good - I feel like even if the coincidence with the missing piece on the train in the beginning doesn’t click, it does at the end with the reveal. The culture is portrayed as much closer to a true utopia than we see in most fiction, so exposing the flaw in the utopia does well in the denouement.</p>
<p><em>Use of Weapons</em> was the darkest, and my favorite of the three so far. The nonlinear narrative was cool. THe twist at the end of this one blew my mind again - I didn’t see it coming at all, and again exposed the flaw in the utopia. I maintain that for a twist to be effective, you have to realize the clues were there in retrospect, but not when you first read them. In this case it was subtly brilliant - the clues weren’t really in the plot, but in the <em>characterization of the main character itself</em>, as someone who will use any weapon to win. Incidentally, the beheading set piece was pretty cool as well.</p>
<p>The ship names are obviously classic.</p>
